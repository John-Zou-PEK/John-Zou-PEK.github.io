From 30th of June to 22nd of August 2025, John participated in the international research opportunities program, becoming one of two students to travel to the Institute of Science Tokyo. Supervised by Prof. Naoto Miyoshi, John studied how broadcast gossip algorithms can be done on weighted graphs. Furthermore, the broadcast gossip algorithm was also further generalised to a more complex setting discussing changes to the mixing parameter as well as a dynamic weighted graph. 

In addition to the project, John attended a seminar on stochastic ordering, studying the classical stochastic order as well as the hazard rate ordering. 

Project notes will be available after the end of the project.
