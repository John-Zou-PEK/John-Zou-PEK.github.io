From 30th of June to 22nd of August 2025, I participated in the international research opportunities program, becoming one of two students to travel to the Institute of Science Tokyo. Supervised by Prof. Naoto Miyoshi, I studied how broadcast gossip algorithms can be done on weighted graphs as well as introducing a stochastic mixing parameter rather than a deterministic one. At the end of the project, I managed to either proof or derive conditions for convergence almost surely of algorithms, including some numerical simulations as well.

In addition to the project, I attended a seminar on stochastic ordering, studying the usual stochastic order as well as the hazard rate ordering. I found it fascinating how this can be used to produce a lattice structure. This is also outlined in the appendix of the project notes.
