I am an undergraduate student at Imperial College London studying mathematics. My interests include applied probability, statistical mechanics and mathematical modelling. 

You can download a copy of my CV [here](/files/Xiaole_Zou_CV.pdf).

I previously studied at Rugby School, UK, from year 9 to year 13, where I gained my initial interest in mathematics thanks to multiple teachers. 
I was fortunate enough to be awarded the mathematics prize for the first four years, and the Wocester Prize awarded to the best mathematician in the school.

During my time at Rugby, I also gained a passion for academic outreach, wanting to share my enthusiasm for mathematics. I wrote an article on Bertrand's Paradox, which is [shortlisted here](https://tomrocksmaths.com/2023/08/07/teddy-rocks-maths-2023-winners-shortlist-part-1/). This also eventually led to the production of my blog on Wechat which is discussed in the projects section.
